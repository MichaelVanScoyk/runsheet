# Sound Files for AV Alerts

Place the following MP3 files in this directory:

1. `dispatch-fire.mp3` - Alert tone for FIRE dispatches
2. `dispatch-ems.mp3` - Alert tone for EMS dispatches  
3. `close.mp3` - Tone for incident cleared/closed

## Recommendations

- Keep files under 500KB for quick loading
- Use distinct, recognizable tones
- Fire dispatch should be more urgent sounding
- EMS dispatch can be different tone/pitch
- Close sound should be subtle/positive

## Sources for Free Alert Tones

- https://freesound.org/ (search for "alert", "siren", "notification")

- Record your own using Audacity

## Testing

After adding files, enable "Sound Alerts" in the sidebar and:
1. Create a test incident to hear dispatch sound
2. Close an incident to hear close sound

TTS (Text-to-Speech) uses browser's built-in speech synthesis.
